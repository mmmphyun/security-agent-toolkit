## Quick start

Use GitHub's **Use this template** button, or create a new Astro project from the repository:

```bash
npm create astro@latest my-blog -- --template dgddgd314/astro-bento-blog-template
cd my-blog
npm install
npm run dev
```

Node.js 22.12.0 or newer is required. The local site runs at `http://localhost:4321` by default.

## Customize the site

Edit `src/config.ts`. This is the main configuration surface for:

- `title`, `description`, and `author`
- document `language` and date `locale`
- deployment `url` and `basePath`
- the two-part wordmark under `brand`
- GitHub, RSS, and other `socialLinks`
- the browser-storage namespace
- View Transitions

For a GitHub Pages project site such as `https://username.github.io/my-blog/`, use:

```ts
url: "https://username.github.io",
basePath: "/my-blog",
```

For a custom domain or a repository named `username.github.io`, use `basePath: "/"`.

UI copy is kept close to the relevant components: the archive is in `src/components/blog/BlogArchive.astro`, and the editor shell is in `src/pages/editor/index.astro`.

## Write posts

Posts are Post JSON v2 documents stored anywhere below `src/content/blog/`. The collection reads `*.json` files recursively.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "meta": {
    "title": "Post title",
    "slug": "post-slug",
    "description": "A short summary for the archive and RSS feed.",
    "pubDate": "2026-08-15",
    "category": "engineering",
    "tags": ["astro", "notes"],
    "status": ["published"]
  },
  "page": {
    "icon": "📝",
    "cover": { "type": "color", "value": "#eaf4ff", "position": 50 }
  },
  "blocks": []
}
```

If `meta.category` is omitted or empty, the folder path becomes the category. For example, `src/content/blog/engineering/post.json` belongs to `engineering`.

### Browser editor

Open `/editor/` during local development. Create or import a document, then use **JSON 저장** to download it. Move the exported file into `src/content/blog/` and rebuild the site.

The editor keeps drafts, recent emoji, and non-secret Drive settings only in the current browser. No account profile or Google access token is persisted. The complete Post JSON contract is available from the editor as `public/editor.md`.

## Google Drive image upload

Drive upload is a built-in editor feature. The rest of the blog works without configuring it; setup begins only when a user chooses **Drive settings** or **Upload to Drive**.

1. Create a Google Drive folder for blog images.
2. Enable the Google Drive API in a Google Cloud project.
3. Create a Web application OAuth client ID.
4. Add the local and deployed origins to **Authorized JavaScript origins**.
5. In `/editor/`, enter the public OAuth client ID and Drive folder ID under **Drive settings**.

The editor requests the narrow `drive.file` scope, stores the access token only in memory, and makes newly uploaded images publicly readable. Never enter a client secret, and do not upload private images. See `public/drive-image-upload.md` for the full setup guide.

## Post network

Posts sharing tags are linked automatically in the network view. Add curated relationships in `src/data/post-network.json`:

```json
{
  "source": "first-post-slug",
  "target": "second-post-slug",
  "type": "reference",
  "label": "reference",
  "weight": 2
}
```

Both `source` and `target` must match post slugs.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Update `SITE.url` and `SITE.basePath` in `src/config.ts`.
2. Push the project to a GitHub repository using the `main` branch.
3. Open **Settings → Pages** in GitHub.
4. Select **GitHub Actions** as the deployment source.
5. Run the included workflow or push another commit.

The workflow uses Node.js 22.12, installs from `package-lock.json`, builds the site, and publishes `dist/`.

If you use Drive uploads on GitHub Pages, add only the origin, such as `https://username.github.io`, to the OAuth client's Authorized JavaScript origins. URL paths are not valid origins.
